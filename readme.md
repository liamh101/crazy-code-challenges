# Crazy Code Chalenges


## Introduction 

Crazy code challenges is a way for me to learn PHP functions in rediculous way. Hopfully helping me learn. 

The reason I started this was to help me towards my Zend PHP Certification exam. I hope this helps you too. 

Anyone's free to use this the way you want. If it's for learning purposes or just to mess around. Go Crazy.
